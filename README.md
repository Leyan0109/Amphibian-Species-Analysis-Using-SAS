# 🐸 Amphibian Species Analysis Using SAS

**Coursework Project — Data Analysis & Reporting**

## 📌 Project Overview

This coursework project consists of two parts:

* **Part 1:** Data Analysis Using **SAS**
* **Part 2:** A short written **report** interpreting the findings

The analysis uses amphibian observation data collected from **189 sites** surrounding two planned motorways in Poland. The dataset includes the presence or absence of several amphibian species such as:

* Green frogs
* Brown frogs
* Common toad
* Fire-bellied toad
* Tree frog
* Common newt
* Great crested newt

The data file (`amphibians.xlsx`) has been provided on Blackboard, originally published on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Amphibians).

## 🎯 Objective

To explore, summarize, and analyze amphibian species data using **SAS**—with a focus on identifying patterns and predicting species presence based on environmental variables.
